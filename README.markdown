# Jack - Making programming playful

Jack is a new language in development that gets translated to pure JavaScript and runs on top of nodeJS.

## Ideals

 - Be Simple! This is very important
 - Be fun! Otherwise, what's the point
 - Be productive! We can only really make time for this is something good comes out of it.

## Technical ideas

 - Compile cleanly down to JavaScript.
 - Use real prototypical inheritance, not the hacked version that made it into JavaScript.
 - Use real whitespace rules and get rid of those semicolons and braces.
 - Create a clean syntax for defining variables, objects and functions/blocks.  That should be all that's needed.
 - Not allow fuzzy things like implicit globals and type coercion.
 - Implement a real compiler with some static analysis, not just regular expression hacks.
 - Unit tests all the way!
